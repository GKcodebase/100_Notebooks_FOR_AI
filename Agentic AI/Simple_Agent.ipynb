        "## What is Agentic AI?\n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional LLM applications that passively respond to prompts, agents actively reason about problems and iteratively refine their approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Characteristics of Agents\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently with minimal human intervention\n",
        "- **Reasoning**: They break down complex problems into manageable steps\n",
        "- **Tool Usage**: Agents leverage external tools (search engines, calculators, APIs) to augment their capabilities\n",
        "- **Iterative Refinement**: They can loop through thought-action-observation cycles to improve results\n",
        "- **Adaptability**: Agents can adjust their strategy based on feedback from their actions\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Agentic Frameworks Matter\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Complex Problem Solving**: Agents can tackle multi-step problems that require planning and tool usage\n",
        "2. **Real-time Information Access**: By using tools, agents can retrieve current information beyond their training data\n",
        "3. **Transparent Reasoning**: The thought-action-observation process provides interpretability\n",
        "4. **Cost Efficiency**: By routing tasks intelligently, agents can reduce unnecessary API calls\n",
        "5. **Scalability**: Agents can handle a wider variety of tasks without being retrained\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a **Simple ReAct Agent** - one of the most effective agentic frameworks that combines Reasoning and Acting in a structured loop."
